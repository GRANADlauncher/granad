# Welcome to GRANAD

GRANAD (GRAphene Nanoflakes with ADatoms) is a tight-binding simulation utility geared towards the exploration of systems at the intersection of solid state physics and quantum optics. Here, we experiment with new stuff.

## Features

- Optical and electronic properties 
- Time-dependent density matrices via master equation
- Relies on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installation

Clone github repo and run


```
pip install -e .
```

## Getting started

After that, you can get started by exploring the tutorials.


## Documentation
The documentation is made with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). You can view it by typing
