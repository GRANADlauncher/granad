# # Custom Time Evolution
#
# GRANAD lets you customize the Master Equation you simulate and extract any information from it.

# *Note*: Please consult the tutorial on potentials first.

# *Note*: While a bit more complicated, this tutorial can help you make your simulations not only more versatile, but also increase their efficiency.

### Hamiltonian

# When calling the integration for the master equation, you can give an optional argument, `hamiltonian`. As already discussed, this argument represents a Hamiltonian as a dictionary of functions.

# Up to now, we  wanted to use custom potentials, so we  added them to the dictionary. Let's look more closely at what is going on by considering a flake under plane wave illumination.

# +
from granad import MaterialCatalog, Triangle, Wave
flake = MaterialCatalog.get( "graphene" ).cut_flake( Triangle(15)  )
wave = Wave( amplitudes = [1.0, 0., 0.], frequency = 1.0 )
hamiltonian_model = flake.get_hamiltonian(illumination = wave)
print(hamiltonian_model.keys())
# -

# As discussed, the default Hamiltonian  has three terms:

# 1. a bare hamiltonian.
# 2. an induced coulomb interaction.
# 3. an external potential.

# Each of these terms is represented by a function. Every function accepts the following three arguments:

# 1. time
# 2. the density matrix at this time
# 3. an argument object `args`. It contains all required "static" information, like relaxation rates, energies or operators in the SchrÃ¶dinger picture.

# Every function maps these arguments to a complex matrix. Before running a simulation, the functions in the dictionary get turned into a list `func_list`. 

# The matrix representation of the Hamiltonian is then given by applying and adding these functions, like so `H[time] = sum( f(times[time], density_matrix[time], args) for f in func_list )`.

### Argument Objects

# The `args` object is a named tuple (like a struct in the C programming language) and we can inspect its contents by looking at its fields 

# +
args = flake.get_args()
print(args._fields)
# -

# We can access individual entries

# +
print(args.dipole_operator.shape)
# -

# The `args` object is a lower-level representation of the OrbitalList object: a collection of numbers and arrays that represent the structure.

# The evolution is determined by the Hamiltonian. It is given by an addition of functions. Each of these functions depends on time, the density matrix and the simulated structure. So, a single function representing a term in the Hamiltonian has the following signature `term: time, density_matrix, args -> matrix`.

### Computing Terms

# Individual terms of the default Hamiltonian can be inspected and since these are functions, applied to arguments. First, consider the bare Hamiltonian

# +
import jax.numpy as jnp
h_bare = hamiltonian_model["bare_hamiltonian"]
time = 0.0
jnp.all(flake.hamiltonian == h_bare( time, args.initial_density_matrix, args ))
# -

# The function returns the bare Hamiltonian, independent of the time and density matrix. Let's compute the Coulomb potential at the initial time

# +
coulomb = hamiltonian_model["coulomb"]
coulomb_matrix = coulomb( time, args.initial_density_matrix, args ) 
jnp.all( coulomb_matrix == 0.0 )
# -

# At the start of the simulation, there is no induced Coulomb potential (all entries in the matrix are zero), because the system is in its ground state.

# Last, there is the external potential. Since no transition dipole moments are considered, it will be entirely diagonal in site basis

# +
potential = hamiltonian_model["potential"]
potential_matrix = potential( time, args.initial_density_matrix, args )
jnp.all( potential_matrix == jnp.diag(potential_matrix.diagonal()) )
# -

### Modelling Terms

# To include arbitrary terms in the time evolution, we define a function that

# 1. Accepts `time, density_matrix, args`
# 2. Returns a NxN complex matrix
# 3. Additionally, the function must be JAX-JIT compatible. In essence, only Python and jax.numpy operations must be used.

# Then, we insert it in the dictionary, potentially overwriting a default key.

# Let's illustrate this at the example of a custom scalar potential. We want to replace the dipole-gauge coupling $\vec{E} \vec{P}$ with a scalar potential representing a plane-wave pulse. Let's define this potential first

# +
amplitudes = jnp.array([1e-5, 0, 0])
omega = 2*jnp.pi
sigma = 1
t0 = 4
def pulsed_potential( time, density_matrix, args ):
    field = (amplitudes * jnp.cos(omega * time) * jnp.exp( -(time-t0)**2 / sigma**2 ) )
    diagonal_part = args.positions @ field
    return jnp.diag( diagonal_part )
# -

# Now, we replace the default potential with our custom term,  as we did before in the case of the pulsed dipole.

# +
hamiltonian_model["potential"] = pulsed_potential
# -

# To run a time-domain simulation, we  pass the modified Hamiltonian dictionary directly, as demonstrated in the first section

# +
result = flake.master_equation( hamiltonian = hamiltonian_model, expectation_values = [flake.dipole_operator], relaxation_rate = 1/10, end_time = 40)
flake.show_res( result )
# -

### Modelling Dissipators

# Dissipators are modelled as functions with the same signature as terms in the Hamiltonian, i.e. to model a custom dissipator

# 1. Define a function `diss : time, density_matrix, args -> jax.Array`
# 2. put it in a dictionary `dissipator_model["diss"] = diss`
# 3. Pass `dissipator = dissipator_model` to the integrator function. 

# You can also get defaults

# +
dissipator_model = flake.get_dissipator(relaxation_rate = 1/10)
print( dissipator_model )
# -

# NOTE: To pass the dissipator above to the `master_equation` method, you have to specify the relaxation rate again. 

### Postprocesses

# You can define custom postprocesses. These are functions with the signature `postprocess : density_matrix_batch, args -> array`. The `density_matrix_batch` is an array of shape `TxNxN`, where `T` encodes time.

# For example, if you are only interested in the occupation of the 0-th state

# +
def extract_element(density_matrices, args):
    return density_matrices[:,0,0]
# -

# +
result = flake.master_equation( postprocesses = {"element" : extract_element},  relaxation_rate = 1/10, end_time = 40 )
print(result.output[0].shape)
# -
