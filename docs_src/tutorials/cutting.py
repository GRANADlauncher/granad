# # Cutting
#

### 4. Cutting
#
# Any material defines a cutting function, but they differ by dimensionality. To see why, let's inspect

# +
from granad import MaterialCatalog
ssh = MaterialCatalog.get("ssh")
help(ssh.cut_flake)
# -

# So, the cut_flake method is automatically determined. Let's look at the 1D case

# +
from granad.materials import cut_flake_1d
help(cut_flake_1d)
# -

# So we just need to specify the number of unit cells. 

# +
flake = ssh.cut_flake( unit_cells = 20, plot = True)
# -

# You may notice this is the configuration with edge states in the band gap

# +
flake.show_energies()
# -

# If you don't want this, just delete the edges by removing the first and the last orbital in the list

# +
del flake[0]
del flake[-1]
flake.show_2d()
flake.show_energies()
# -

# That's pretty much all about cutting in 1D. Let's cover 2D.

# +
from granad.materials import cut_flake_2d
help(cut_flake_2d)
# -

# This is more complex. We can give an arbitrary polygon to the cutting function, so let's do this by approximating a potato (this is an internal joke in Carsten's group).

# +
import jax.numpy as jnp
potato = 10 * jnp.array( [
  (3, 1),    # Bottom center (widest point)
  (2, 2),    # Lower left bulge
  (1, 3),    # Mid left indent
  (2, 4),    # Upper left bulge
  (3, 5),    # Top center
  (4, 4),    # Upper right bulge
  (5, 3),    # Mid right indent
  (4, 2),    # Lower right bulge
  (3, 1)     # Connect back to the bottom center
])
# -

# Now, we cut a flake

# +
graphene = MaterialCatalog.get("graphene")
flake = graphene.cut_flake( potato, plot = True )
# -

#
### Shapes
#
# Built-in shapes are a bit more boring: they are just functions returning a set of vertices. All parameters you pass to them are in Angstr√∂m.

# +
from granad import Rectangle
help(Rectangle)
# -

### Bearded configurations

# Cutting removes "dangling" atoms by default. Dangling atoms are defined by their neighbor number: if they have only one neighbor, they are removed. If you want to deactivate this to keep "bearded" configurations, do

# +
flake = graphene.cut_flake( Rectangle(10,10), plot = True, minimum_neighbor_number = 0 )
# -
