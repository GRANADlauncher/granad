# Welcome to GRANAD

GRANAD (GRAphene Nanoflakes with ADatoms) is a tight-binding simulation utility geared towards the exploration of systems at the intersection of solid state physics and quantum optics.

## Features

- Computes optical and electronic properties 
- Full access to time-dependent density matrices via master equation
- Relies on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for performance and differentiability

## Installation

Clone github repo and run

```
pip install -e .
```

## Getting started

After that, you can get started by exploring the tutorials.
